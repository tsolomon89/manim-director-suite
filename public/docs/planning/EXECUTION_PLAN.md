## üìã Executive Summary

This document defines the ACTUAL implementation order based on:
1. ‚úÖ User-assigned priorities (High/Medium/Low)
2. ‚úÖ Technical dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Logical development flow
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical design questions that need investigation

**Focus**: Implement High & Medium priority features ONLY. Skip Low/Very Low.

## üö® CRITICAL DESIGN QUESTIONS (Investigate First)

Before starting implementation, we need to answer these fundamental questions:

### Q1: Canvas Video Export vs Manim - Strategy Decision
**User Question**: "If we can do video export from canvas, what's the point of Manim?"

**Investigation Needed**:
- Research MediaRecorder API for canvas recording
- Compare quality: Canvas recording vs Manim-rendered video
- Test performance: Can canvas maintain 60 FPS during recording?
- Feature comparison: What does Manim provide that canvas doesn't?
  - LaTeX rendering quality
  - Vector graphics vs raster
  - Mathematical precision
  - Professional animation features

**Impact**: If canvas video works well, could simplify entire export pipeline
**Timeline**: 2-3 days research before Phase 1
**Decision Point**: Determines if we prioritize F24 (Manim Live) or F25 (Canvas Video)

---

### Q2: Advanced Coloring System - Architecture Design
**User Note**: "This is VERY IMPORTANT and COMPLEX - needs to be fleshed out completely"

**What needs design**:
1. **Coloring Modes**:
   - Escape-time (Mandelbrot-style)
   - Distance fields (proximity to paths/curves)
   - Tension/heat maps (parameter impact visualization)
   - Mathematical function-based colors
   - Gradient rules and parameters

2. **Questions**:
   - How do users define coloring functions?
   - UI for gradient editor?
   - Performance for real-time coloring of 100K+ points?
   - Integration with GPU renderer?

**Comparison Research**:
- What does Desmos do? (limited coloring)
- What does GeoGebra do? (parameter-based coloring)
- How can we do it better/more powerful/more elegant?

**Impact**: Core to fractal rendering (P11) and data visualization
**Timeline**: 3-4 days design + prototyping before Phase 2
**Deliverable**: Coloring system spec document

---

### Q3: 3D Scene + Manim Integration
**User Question**: "Need to plan this better. How does this interact with Manim?"

**Investigation Needed**:
- Manim 3D capabilities (what can it render?)
- Three.js ‚Üí Manim export path (how to translate?)
- Should we:
  - Option A: Keep 3D preview-only, export to Manim 2D projections
  - Option B: Full 3D Manim integration
  - Option C: Separate 3D canvas export (skip Manim for 3D)

**Impact**: Determines Phase 12 scope and complexity
**Timeline**: 2-3 days research
**Decision Point**: Before starting P10 (3D Camera System)

---

### Q4: LaTeX Rendering - Viewer vs Export
**User Note**: "Need to figure out translation between real-time viewer and Manim render"

**Technical Challenge**:
- Real-time viewer: Use KaTeX (browser-based, fast)
- Manim export: Uses LaTeX + dvisvgm (different system)
- How to ensure consistency?

**Design Options**:
- Option A: Dual rendering - KaTeX for preview, LaTeX commands for Manim
- Option B: Pre-render LaTeX to SVG, embed in both systems
- Option C: WebAssembly LaTeX engine (consistent everywhere)

**Impact**: Critical for F28 (LaTeX Overlay)
**Timeline**: 2-3 days prototyping
**Deliverable**: LaTeX rendering strategy document
