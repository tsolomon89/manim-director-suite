| **F11** | **Parameter Folders/Groups** | Organization | Small | Medium | ‚è≥ | Organize parameters into collapsible folders (like Desmos) | Low |  |
| **F12** | **Advanced Coloring System** | Visualization | Large | **CRITICAL** | ‚úÖ | **RENAMED & ELEVATED**: Programmatic gradients, coloring functions, proximity-based coloring, tension/heat maps. Goes beyond simple color picker to support Mandelbrot-style escape-time coloring, distance fields, mathematical function-based colors. **CONSOLIDATED WITH P12** | **CRITICAL** | **User Note**: "How do we shade a plane and show tension on it or some parameter's impact via the visuals. Maybe color a plane relative to its proximity to some path. This is VERY IMPORTANT and COMPLEX - needs to be fleshed out completely. What would Desmos/GeoGebra do and how do we do it better/more powerful/more elegant?" |
| **F13** | **Grid Snap Toggle** | UX | Small | Low | ‚úÖ | Snap camera/values to grid increments | High |  |
| **F14** | **Quadrant/Region Bookmarks** | UX | Small | Medium | ‚úÖ | **ENHANCED**: Snap to sectors/regions: (+x,+y), (+x,-y), (-x,+y), (-x,-y), all-quadrants. Each bookmark includes optimal z/zoom for showing the region properly. | Medium | **User Note**: "Should be more like snap to sector or regions, not just arbitrary positions. Need to set z or zoom relative to showing the right space." |
| **F15** | **Expression Autocomplete** | UX | Medium | Medium | ‚è≥ | Suggest parameter names, functions while typing | Low | Would be better suited to only do this for greeks. Consider most common use case would be coping output from markdown from AI models and desmos.  |
| **F16** | **Live Error Preview** | UX | Small | High | ‚è≥ | Show expression errors inline as you type (before submitting) |  | Not sure if we need this debugging or its nice to have? |
| **F17** | **Function Statistics Panel** | Analysis | Small | Medium | ‚úÖ | **‚Üí EXTENDED BY P4, P5** \- Show min/max/zeros/asymptotes for selected function | **Unknown** |  |
| **F18** | **Derivative/Integral Plotting** | Math Engine | Medium | High | ‚úÖ | Plot f'(x) and ‚à´f(x)dx alongside f(x) |  | What would desmos do? |

| **F23** | **Multi-Layer Rendering System** | Timeline | Large | High | ‚úÖ | **ENHANCED**: Beyond multi-track timeline - support rendering to multiple layers/PNGs that can be composited. Critical for massive datasets (100M+ points) - break into layers and stack PNGs. Requires tree/planning UI in separate widget. | Medium | **User Note**: "More critically than timeline tracks: multi-layer rendering. When rendering hundreds of millions of points, break down to many layers on output and composite PNGs on top of one another." |
| **F24** | **Manim Live Render** | Export | Large | High | ‚úÖ | Subprocess integration to render Manim video directly from app | Unknown | Do we need this for core functionality? |
| **F25** | **Canvas Video Export** | Export | Large | **HIGH** | ‚úÖ | **CRITICAL QUESTION**: Real-time canvas recording to video (no Manim). If this works, fundamentally changes export strategy. | **HIGH** | **User Note**: "If we can do this, what's the point of Manim? NEED TO DIVE DEEPER into canvas video recording vs Manim quality/features." **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED** |
| **F26** | **GIF/Video Export (Canvas)** | Export | Small | Medium | ‚úÖ | **MERGED WITH F25**: Export timeline as animated GIF or video directly from canvas (no Manim needed) | Low | Low Priority - same as F25 |
| **F27** | **Multi-Format Image Export** | Export | Medium | Medium | ‚úÖ | **GENERALIZED**: Export current frame in multiple formats: PNG, SVG, JPEG, WebP. Unified export dialog. | Low | **User Note**: "Should be general 'Image' export with different formats, not just SVG." |
| **F28** | **LaTeX Overlay System** | Annotations | Medium | High | ‚úÖ | **CRITICAL**: LaTeX text/equations as annotations. **Design Question**: How to render LaTeX in real-time canvas viewer vs Manim export? Need KaTeX for browser, but Manim uses different system. | High | **User Note**: "Core Manim function. Need to figure out translation between real-time viewer and Manim render." **DESIGN REQUIRED** |
| **F29** | **Point/Line Annotations** | Annotations | Small | Medium | ‚è≥ | Mark specific points, draw reference lines | High |  |
| **F30** | **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** | UI | Small | Low | ‚úÖ | User preference for dark vs light mode | Low |  |
| **F31** | **Preset Import/Export** | Config | Small | Medium | ‚úÖ | Share grid styles/color schemes as files | Medium | Ties to F32,**F48**This is important as we can preload and define some core experiments and things i want to visualize in the sandbox of the app we are building. Dont know what .pkstudio files are though. But the idea should be even though i am building a general use case app, lets build a ‚Äòuser project‚Äô or template that is what i want to be plotting. That way we can work backwards making sure the program is as general as I want but still fit the specific use cases. |
| **F32** | **Project Templates** | Workflow | Medium | High | ‚è≥ | Start from templates (calculus, physics, complex analysis, fractals) | Very Low | Very Low Priority  |
| **F33** | **Collaborative Editing** | Advanced | X-Large | Medium | ‚ùå | Real-time multi-user editing (WebRTC/WebSockets) | N/A |  |
| **F34** | **Cloud Storage Integration** | Advanced | Large | Low | ‚è≥ | Save/load from Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. | Very Low | Very Low Priority  |
| **F35** | **Command Palette** | UX | Small | High | ‚úÖ | Ctrl+K to search all commands/settings | High |  |
| **F36** | **Web Workers for Eval** | Performance | Medium | High | ‚úÖ | **‚Üí EXTENDED BY P8** \- Offload expression evaluation to background thread | High |  |
| **F37** | **Canvas Off-Screen Rendering** | Performance | Medium | Medium | ‚úÖ | Pre-render to off-screen canvas for smoother playback | High |  |
| **F38** | **Memoization Cache** | Performance | Small | Medium | ‚úÖ | Cache expensive calculations (already partial support) | High |  |
| **F39** | **Progressive Rendering** | Performance | Medium | High | ‚úÖ | **‚Üí CONSOLIDATED INTO P9** \- Low quality while animating, high quality on idle | High |  |
| **F40** | **Mobile/Tablet Support** | Accessibility | Large | Medium | ‚úÖ | Touch gestures, responsive layout | Very Low | Very Low Priority  |
| **F41** | **Screen Reader Support** | Accessibility | Medium | Low | ‚úÖ | ARIA labels, keyboard nav improvements | Very Low | Very Low Priority  |
| **F42** | **High Contrast Mode** | Accessibility | Small | Low | ‚úÖ | Accessibility preset for vision impairment | Very Low | Very Low Priority  |
| **F43** | **Unit Tests Expansion** | Quality | Medium | High | ‚úÖ | Increase coverage from current to 100% | High |  |
| **F44** | **Integration Tests** | Quality | Medium | High | ‚úÖ | End-to-end workflow tests | High |  |
| **F45** | **CI/CD Pipeline** | DevOps | Medium | Medium | ‚úÖ | GitHub Actions for auto-test and deploy | High |  |
| **F46** | **Documentation Site** | Docs | Large | High | ‚è≥ | Full docs website with tutorials, examples | High | CRITICAL\! Should be more KISS just a Docs page or view route in the app itself. We will actually use this for the documentation of the app and context for more AI work so this might be CRITICAL. NOT a full website, tutorial, examples. Basic MD reader for MD documents in the some folder in the app. This would include the read me. Changes logs, how to guides, etcs. We need some basic sorting, and navigation between types of content in the folder so many some meta data it it would be needed to know how to sort each doc when read in the app (and to help an AI too). So then we‚Äôd we‚Äôd also update [`Agents.md`](http://Agents.md) and [`Claude.md`](http://Claude.md) files to point to this folder for the Ai to learn more about the project as need as its own knowledge base and context repo. |
| **F47** | **Video Tutorials** | Docs | Large | Medium | ‚ùå | YouTube series on using the tool | N/A |  |
| **F48** | **Example Projects Gallery** | Docs | Medium | High | ‚è≥ | Pre-built .pkstudio files showcasing features (including Mandelbrot, tessellations) | Unknown |  |
| **F49** | **Plugin System** | Architecture | X-Large | High | ‚ùå | Allow custom transforms, plotters, exporters via plugins | N/A |  |
| **F50** | **WebAssembly Math Engine** | Performance | X-Large | Medium | ‚è≥ | Rewrite core math in Rust/WASM for speed | Unknown | What kind of difference would this make? |
